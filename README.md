# College-Football-Team-Finder
### Live Site: https://cfteamfinder.netlify.app/

## Description
I created this college football landing page app because of my love and interest in the sport. This app finds info for all of the CFB college football teams such as nick name, location, conference, and region. I created this landing page app from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and a JSON file with each school's information that is imported to the JavaScript file.
